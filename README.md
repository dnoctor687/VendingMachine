# VendingMachine

**Java Vending Machine Simulator**

**Project Overview**
This repository contains a Java-based simulation of a vending machine, designed as a showcase of object-oriented programming principles, robust error handling, and user-friendly console interaction.
I created this project for one of my assignments and decided to build on it to display to potential employers.

**Features**
Interactive Console Interface: A simple yet intuitive console-based user interface for product selection and coin insertion.
Dynamic Product Selection: Users can select products from a pre-defined list with prices and descriptions.
Coin Handling Mechanism: Accepts multiple coin denominations and calculates balance and change due.
Engineer Access Mode: Special access functionality for maintenance and restocking (simulated).
Robust Error Handling: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and system errors.
Unit Testing: Includes tests for key components, ensuring reliability and correctness.

**Technical Highlights**
Object-Oriented Design: Demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, and interfaces.

Error Handling: Exception handling and user input validation.

Code Quality: Adheres to coding standards with clear naming conventions and comments.

Version Control: Developed using Git, showcasing effective use of version control in software development.

**How to Run**
Instructions on how to compile and run the application are provided, making it easy for users to test and interact with the simulator.

**Future Enhancements**
Enhancing the user interface with more interactive elements.
Adding a feature for inventory management and dynamic pricing.

**About the Developer**
As a recent computer science graduate, I am passionate about creating efficient and user-friendly software solutions.
This project is part of my journey in exploring advanced Java features and software design best practices.
